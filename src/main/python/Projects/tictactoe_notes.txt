1. Difficulties: easy, medium, hard, impossible

2.1. Easy:
    - AI chooses random positions for game
    - User can choose to go first or second

2.2. Medium:
    - IA aims to win
    - User can choose to go first or second

2.3. Hard:
    - In the first turn:
        - IA will take the middle cell if available
        - Else it will take a corner
    - IA aims to block if the user has 2 cells in power, if the user has started first, if the IA doesn't have 2 cells in power at the moment of deciding
    - IA aims to win if a block is not needed and if the IA has 2 cells in power

2.4. Impossible:
    - Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
    - Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
    - Fork: Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
    - Blocking an opponent's fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. 
      Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to make two in a row. 
      Otherwise, the player should make a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it does not result in them producing a fork. 
      For example, if "X" has two opposite corners and "O" has the center, "O" must not play a corner move to win. 
      (Playing a corner move in this scenario produces a fork for "X" to win.)
    - Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, 
      playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; 
      however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
    - Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
    - Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
    - Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.

3. Error handling:
    - Implement elif instead of Else
    - raise errors
CURRENT BUGS AND HOW TO FIX
    1. Have to arrange tie situation
        Instead of win returning True and lose returning false, have them return "Win", "Tie" or "Loss", ig.
    2. Have to fix turnsum not working properly on AI turns --> right now turn doesnt get updated on user side properly
        Not sure on how to fix, investigating
